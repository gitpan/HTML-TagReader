This module is similar to while(<>) but instead of reading lines 
it reads tags or tags and text.

To install run:
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The subdirectory bin contains 3 applications of Tagreader:
blck -- check for broken relative links in html pages
llnk -- list links in html files
xlnk -- expand links on directories

httpcheck -- check if a particular web-pages exists
             httpcheck does not directyl use the Tagreader module
             but may be used as post processor for blck   
             If you are interessted in a link checker to check
             links only via the web-server then this is not the
             right program for you. Other programs like e.g curl 
             (http://curl.haxx.nu/ or http://curl.haxx.se/)
             can be used if you want to check your web-pages only 
             remotely via a web server. curl comes with a dead link 
             checker called checklinks.pl.

Note the primary desing goal of Tagreader is to provide a fast
way of reading html file. 

These will normally be install to /usr/bin/
